Eyeriss use PE set to do matrix convolution which reuse filters across columns, ifmaps diagonally, and partial sum vertically. Challenge 3: mapping different size of operations. The PE set size is flexible. the PE arrays can be divided into several sets, and one large convolution operation can be divided into several steps using strip minign. Challenge 4: dealing with demensions beyond 2-D: concatenating spatially or interleaving temporally are used to fit in larger dimension in one PE set, besides, multiple PE sets can be used to treat high dimension simultaneously. Moreover, multiple processing passes with efficient scheduling are used when one pass cannot finish one convolution opearation.\n"
